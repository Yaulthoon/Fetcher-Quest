  I just finished the character creation process and a workable demo is
  within our grasp! I have had less time of late to work on my projects
  due to personal responsibilities, but I remain committed to furthering
  both this project and my own knowledge. Next on the agenda: adding more
  minigames and creating the overworld pages to produce a small, but working
  demo of the game itself.

  After I get a feel for the requirements, I will
  start working on the backend aspects of Fetcher Quest. I hope to allow
  users to save their game if they choose to. I have no timeline for this,
  but the the app will have to migrate to a site that will support it better
  such as Heroku if that does take place. That being said, please feel free
  to try out the character creation for yourself. Happy Halloween to everyone!

  It has been quite some time since the last update to Fetcher Quest!
  I have been busy updating my Quiz Maker app from the ground up,
  learning new technologies (Java, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express), so
  this project suffered from a lack of updates. That should change
  soon as I start to primarily focus on this app with the latest batch
  of Quiz Maker updates completed. The new minigame is basically a
  count to 20 game where the player who counts to 20 wins. Harvey is
  certainly no slouch, so expect to need all of your cunning to best him!
