# Fetcher Quest

Fetcher Quest will be a text-based, single player game that stars Lupin Fetcher and his last great adventure.  I am currently building assets for this project, so I have no timetable for its completion.  Please feel free to check in on its current progress from time to time with the link provided in the description.  Once the project begins to take shape, I will likely create a website for the actual game itself.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.7.

## Commit on 09/10/2018
I added a new minigame to Fetcher Quest and reorganized components and services into separate subfolders for future scalability.  As I did with my Quiz Maker app, separating components and services will simply help me stay organized as content increases in both complexity and size.  Next commit will likely include a character creation tool and CSS queries to accommodate Microsoft Edge further (noticed some text clipping issues with smaller screens, etc).
