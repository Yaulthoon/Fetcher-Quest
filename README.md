# Fetcher Quest

Fetcher Quest will be a text-based, single player game that stars Lupin Fetcher and his last great adventure.  I am currently building assets for this project, so I have no timetable for its completion.  Please feel free to check in on its current progress from time to time with the link provided in the description.  Once the project begins to take shape, I will likely create a website for the actual game itself.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.7.
